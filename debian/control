Description: neuroscience-oriented distribution - repository configuration
 The NeuroDebian project integrates and maintains a variety of software
 projects within Debian that are useful for neuroscience (such as AFNI,
 FSL, PsychoPy, etc.) or generic computation (such as HTCondor,
 pandas, etc.).
 .
 This package enables the NeuroDebian repository on top of a standard
 Debian or Ubuntu system.

Description: neuroscience-oriented distribution - GnuPG archive keys
 The NeuroDebian project integrates and maintains a variety of software
 projects within Debian that are useful for neuroscience (such as AFNI,
 FSL, PsychoPy, etc.) or generic computation (such as HTCondor,

Description: nd_freeze tool to freeze APT sources to use snapshots
 The NeuroDebian project integrates and maintains a variety of software
 projects within Debian that are useful for neuroscience (such as AFNI,
 FSL, PsychoPy, etc.) or generic computation (such as HTCondor,
 pandas, etc.).
 .
 This minimalistic package provides nd_freeze script to be used in
 rich or minimalistic environments (such as Docker or Singularity 
 recipes) to freeze their APT sources.  Intended to assist making such
 images reproducible.

Description: neuroscience-oriented distribution - popcon integration
 The NeuroDebian project integrates and maintains a variety of software
 projects within Debian that are useful for neuroscience (such as AFNI,
 FSL, PsychoPy, etc.) or generic computation (such as HTCondor,
 pandas, etc.).
 .
 This package is a complement to the generic popularity-contest
 package to enable anonymous submission of usage statistics to
 NeuroDebian in addition to the popcon submissions to the underlying
 distribution (either Debian or Ubuntu) popcon server.
 .
 Participating in popcon is important for the following reasons:
  * Popular packages receive more attention from developers; bugs are
    fixed faster and updates are provided quicker.
  * It ensures that support is not dropped for a previous release of
    Debian or Ubuntu while there are active users.
  * User statistics may be useful for upstream research software
    developers seeking funding for continued development.
 .
 This requires that popcon is activated for the underlying distribution
 (Debian or Ubuntu), which can be achieved by running
 "dpkg-reconfigure popularity-contest" as root.
